    <p>"Welcome, and thank you for your interest in The Authors ('Pol.is', 'we,'
    or 'us') and our Web site at <a href='http://pol.is/'>http://pol.is/</a> (the
    'Site'), as well as all related web sites, networks, embeddable widgets, downloadable
    software, mobile applications (including tablet applications), and other services
    provided by us and on which a link to these Terms of Use is displayed (collectively,
    together with the Site, our 'Service'). These Terms of Use are a legally binding
    contract between you and Pol.is regarding your use of the Service."</p>

    <p>"PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY. BY CLICKING 'I ACCEPT,' YOU
    ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE POL.IS PRIVACY POLICY <a href=
    'https://pol.is/privacy'>https://pol.is/privacy</a> (COLLECTIVELY, THESE 'TERMS'). If
    you are not eligible, or do not agree to these Terms, then please do not use the
    Service."</p>

    <p>"These Terms of Use provide that all disputes between you and Pol.is will be
    resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to
    assert or defend your rights under this contract (except for matters that may be
    taken to small claims court). Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR
    and NOT a judge or jury and your claims cannot be brought as a class action. Please
    review the Arbitration Agreement below for the details regarding your agreement to
    arbitrate any disputes with Pol.is."</p>

    <ol>

      Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us: (i) that you
      are at least thirteen (13) years of age; (ii) that you have not previously been
      suspended or removed from the Service; and (iii) that your registration and your
      use of the Service is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and
      regulations. If you are using the Service on behalf of an entity, organization, or

      accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you
      register, you will be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for
      maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password. You agree to accept
      responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you have reason
      to believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify
      us at info@pol.is."</li>

      <li>"Payment. Access to the Service, or to certain features of the Service, may
      require you to pay fees. Before you are required to pay any fees, you will have an
      opportunity to review and accept the applicable fees that you will be charged. All
      fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable. Pol.is may change the fees for the
      Service or any feature of the Service, including by adding additional fees or
      charges, on a going-forward basis at any time. Pol.is will charge the payment
      method you specify at the time of purchase. You authorize Pol.is to charge all sums
      described herein to such payment method. If you pay any applicable fees with a
      credit card, Pol.is may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to
      your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds
      or credit available to cover your purchase."</li>

          <li>"User Content Generally. Certain features of the Service may permit users
          to post content, including messages, questions, responses, data, text, and
          other types of works (collectively, 'User Content') and to publish User Content
          on the Service. You retain copyright and any other proprietary rights that you
          may hold in the User Content that you post to the Service."</li>

          <li>"Limited License Grant to Pol.is. By posting or publishing User Content,
          you grant Pol.is a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license
          (with the right to sublicense) to host, store, transfer, display, perform,
          reproduce, modify, and distribute your User Content, in whole or in part, in
          any media formats and through any media channels (now known or hereafter
          developed). Any such use of your User Content by Pol.is may be without any
          compensation paid to you."</li>

          User Content with another user of the Service, you hereby grant to other users

      granted by you in this Section 4 and in the manner contemplated by Pol.is and these
      Terms; and "</li>

      <li>"your User Content, and the use thereof as contemplated herein, does not and
      will not: (i) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third-party right, including
      any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right
      of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; or (ii)
      slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property
      rights of any other person."

        <ol>
          <li>"User Content Disclaimer. We are under no obligation to edit or control
          User Content that you or other users post or publish, and will not be in any
          way responsible or liable for User Content. Pol.is may, however, at any time
          and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any User Content that
          in our sole judgment violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable. You
          understand that when using the Service you will be exposed to User Content from
          a variety of sources and acknowledge that User Content may be inaccurate,
          offensive, indecent or objectionable. You agree to waive, and hereby do waive,
          any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against Pol.is
          with respect to User Content. We expressly disclaim any and all liability in
          connection with User Content. If notified by a user or content owner that User
          Content allegedly does not conform to these Terms, we may investigate the
          allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove the User
          Content, which we reserve the right to do at any time and without notice. For
          clarity, Pol.is does not permit copyright-infringing activities on the
          Service."</li>

        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>"Third-Party Services and Linked Websites. Pol.is may provide tools through the
      Service that enable you to export information, including User Content, to third

      your user account on the Service or suspend or terminate your access to the Service
      at any time, with or without notice. We also reserve the right to modify or
      discontinue the Service at any time (including, without limitation, by limiting or
      discontinuing certain features of the Service) without notice to you. We will have
      no liability whatsoever on account of any change to the Service or any suspension
      or termination of your access to or use of the Service. You may terminate your
      account at any time by contacting customer service at info@pol.is. If you terminate
      your account, you will remain obligated to pay all outstanding fees, if any,
      relating to your use of the Service incurred prior to termination. To the extent
      permitted by applicable laws and regulations, no unused portions of pre-paid fees
      will be refunded following termination."</li>

      <li>"Privacy Policy; Additional Terms"

        <ol>
          <li>"Privacy Policy. Please read the Pol.is Privacy Policy [<a href=
          'https://pol.is/privacy'>https://pol.is/privacy</a>] carefully for information

      and you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Pol.is and its officers,
      directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and agents

    <p>"NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE

      <li>"Limitation of Liability: IN NO EVENT WILL THE POL.IS ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU

      SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR

      APPLY TO YOU. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF
      LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE
      RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL
      ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS
      IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE
      LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 13 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS
      ESSENTIAL PURPOSE."</li>

      <li>"Governing Law. These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of
      Washington without regard to conflict of law principles. To the extent that any
      lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, you and Pol.is agree to submit
      to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts
      located within King County, Washington for the purpose of litigating all such
      disputes. We operate the Service from our offices in Washington, and we make no
      representation that Materials included in the Service are appropriate or available
      for use in other locations."</li>

      <li>"General. These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other
      agreements expressly incorporated by reference herein, constitute the entire and
      exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Pol.is regarding your use of
      and access to the Service, and except as expressly permitted above may be amended
      only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to
      these Terms. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights hereunder,
      in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written
      consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice. The failure to
      require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require
      performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of
      these Terms or any provision of these Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent
      breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in
      these Terms is for convenience only and shall not have any impact on the
      interpretation of particular provisions. In the event that any part of these Terms
      is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part shall be given
      effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full
      force and effect. Upon termination of these Terms, any provision that by its nature
      or express terms should survive will survive such termination or expiration,
      including, but not limited to, Sections 1, 3, and Error! Reference source not
      found. through 17."</li>

      <li>"Dispute Resolution and Arbitration"

        <ol>
          <li>"Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Pol.is in
          the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Pol.is agree that any and
          all disputes arising in connection with these Terms shall be resolved by
          binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
          Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for
          more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review
          by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can
          award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all
          claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based
          in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory,
          and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of
          these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU
          AND POL.IS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A
          CLASS ACTION."</li>

          <li>"Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection 16.1, we both agree that nothing
          herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our
          right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue
          enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where
          such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or
          (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property
          infringement claims."</li>

          <li>"Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Pol.is will be governed by the
          Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for
          Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, 'AAA Rules') of the American
          Arbitration Association ('AAA'), as modified by these Terms, and will be
          administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at
          www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting
          Pol.is."</li>

          <li>"Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a
          written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal
          Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical
          address on file for you, by electronic mail ('Notice'). The address of Pol.is
          for Notice is: The Authors 3601 Fremont Ave. N, Suite 300 Seattle, WA
          98103. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or
          dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ('Demand'). We agree to
          use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an
          agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Pol.is
          may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of
          any settlement offer made by you or Pol.is shall not be disclosed to the
          arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.
          In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor,
          Pol.is shall pay you (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the
          last written settlement amount offered by Pol.is in settlement of the dispute
          prior to the arbitrator's award; or (iii) $1,000.00, whichever is
          greater."</li>

          <li>"Fees. In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these
          Terms, Pol.is will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless
          your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees
          shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at
          a location to be agreed upon in King County, Washington, provided that if the
          claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be
          conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator;
          (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an
          in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of
          your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your
          claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an
          improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of
          Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the
          AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Pol.is for all monies
          previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the
          AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the
          arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the
          essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are
          based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment
          and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and
          upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling
          on the merits."</li>

          <li>"No Class Actions. YOU AND POL.IS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST
          THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR
          CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further,
          unless both you and Pol.is agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate
          more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
          representative or class proceeding."</li>

          <li>"Modifications. In the event that Pol.is makes any future change to this
          arbitration provision (other than a change to the address of Pol.is for
          Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30
          days of the change to the address of Pol.is for Notice, in which case your
          account with Pol.is shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration
          provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall
          survive."</li>

          <li>"Enforceability. If Subsection 16.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the
          entirety of this Section 16 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of
          this Section 16 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree
          that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 14 shall govern
          any action arising out of or related to these Terms."</li>
