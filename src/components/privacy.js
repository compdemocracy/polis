      <p>POL.IS PRIVACY POLICY</p>

      <p>Last Updated: <strong><em>6/26/2014 <strong><em>_</em></strong></em></strong></p>

      <p>"This privacy policy (this 'Policy') describes the collection of personal
      information by The Authors., a Delaware corporation ('Pol.is,' 'we,' or
      'us') from users of our Web site at <a href='http://polis/'>'http://pol.is/'</a> (the
      'Website'), as well as all related applications, widgets, software, tools, and other
      services provided by us and on which a link to this Policy is displayed
      (collectively, together with the Website, our 'Services'). This Policy also describes
      our use and disclosure of such information. By using our Services, you consent to the
      collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in accordance with this
      Policy. This Policy is incorporated by reference into the Pol.is Terms of Use
      <a href='https://pol.is/tos'>'https://pol.is/tos'</a> and subject to the provisions
      of the Pol.is Terms of Use."</p>

      <p>Personal Information</p>

      <p>"'Personal Information,' as used in this Policy, is information that specifically
      identifies an individual, such as an individual's name, address, credit card
      information, telephone number, or e-mail address. Personal Information also includes
      information about an individual's activities, such as information about his or her
      activity on our Services, and demographic information, such as date of birth, gender,
      geographic area, organization, job title, and preferences, when any of this
      information is linked to Personal Information that identifies that individual."</p>

      <p>"Personal Information does not include 'aggregate' or other non-personally
      identifiable information. Aggregate information is information that we collect about
      a group or category of products, services, or users that is not personally
      identifiable or from which individual identities are removed. We may use and disclose
      aggregate information, and other non-personally identifiable information, for various
      purposes."</p>

      <p>Collection of Information</p>

      <p>Collection of Voluntarily-Provided Information</p>

      <p>We collect Personal Information that our users provide to us in a variety of ways
      on our Services. These include the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>"User Accounts and Profiles. Our Services may give you the ability to register
        for a Company account or to create and update a user profile on the applicable
        Service. If we offer user account or profile functionality on the Services, we will
        collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of
        registering for an account or creating or updating a user profile. This information
        may include, for example, name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address,
        and related demographic information about you. We may indicate that some personal
        information is required for you to register for the account or to create the
        profile, while some is optional."</li>

        <li>"Integrated Services. You may be given the option to access or register for the
        Services through the use of your user name and passwords for certain services
        provided by third parties (each an 'Integrated Service'), such as through the use
        of your Facebook credentials through Facebook Connect. By doing this, you authorize
        us to access and store the credentials you provide, your name, email address(es),
        date of birth, gender, current city, profile picture URL and other information that
        the Integrated Service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in
        accordance with this Policy. You should check your Facebook or other Integrated
        Service privacy settings to understand and change the information sent to us
        through Facebook Connect or other Integrated Services. Please review each
        Integrated Service's terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their
        services and connecting to our Services"</li>

        <li>"Interactive Features. Our Services may contain interactive functionality that
        allows you to engage with other users on the Services, post questions to other
        users, answer questions of other users, post comments to questions and other
        forums, to upload other content (the 'User Materials'), participate in surveys, and
        otherwise to interact with the Services and with other users. If you use any
        interactive functionality on our Services that request or permit you to provide us
        with personal information (including, for example, any services that allow you to
        post User Materials on any of our Services), we collect the Personal Information
        that you provide to us in the course of using these interactive features. "</li>

        <li>"Correspondence. If you contact us by e-mail, using a contact form on the
        Services, or by mail, fax, or other means, we collect the Personal Information
        contained within, and associated with, your correspondence."</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Passive Information Collection</p>

      <p>"When you visit our Services, some information is collected automatically. For
      example, when you access our Services, we automatically collect your browser's
      Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type, the nature of the device from
      which you are visiting the Services (e.g., a personal computer or a mobile device),
      the identifier for any handheld or mobile device that you may be using, the Web site
      that you visited immediately prior to accessing any Web-based Services, the actions
      you take on our Services, and the content, features, and activities that you access
      and participate in on our Services. We also may collect information regarding your
      interaction with e-mail messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or
      forwarded a message."</p>

      <p>"We may collect this information passively using technologies such as cookies. We
      use passively-collected information to administer, operate, and improve the Website
      and our other services and systems, to improve the effectiveness of advertising on
      our Services, and to provide advertisements and other content that is tailored to
      you. If we link or associate any information gathered through passive means with
      Personal Information, or if applicable laws require us to treat any information
      gathered through passive means as Personal Information, we treat the combined
      information as Personal Information under this Policy. Otherwise, we use and disclose
      information collected by passive means in aggregate form or otherwise in a
      non-personally identifiable form."</p>

      <p>"Also, please be aware that third parties, such as companies displaying
      advertisements on the Services or sites or services provided by third parties
      ('Third-Party Sites') that may be linked to from the Services, may set cookies on
      your hard drive or use other means of passively collecting information about your use
      of their services, Third-Party Sites or content. We do not have access to, or control
      over, these third-party means of passive data collection."</p>

      <p>Information from Other Sources</p>

      <p>"We may receive information about you, including Personal Information, from third
      parties and third party application programming interfaces, as well as authentication
      service providers, and may combine this information with other Personal Information
      we maintain about you. If we do so, this Policy governs any combined information that
      we maintain in personally identifiable format."</p>

      <p>Use of Personal Information</p>

      <p>"We use Personal Information to provide services and information that you request;
      to enhance, improve, operate, and maintain our Services, our programs, services, Web
      sites, and other systems; to prevent fraudulent use of our Services and other
      systems; to prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in
      violation of our Terms of Use or applicable law; to tailor advertisements, content,
      and other aspects of your experience on and in connection with the Services; to
      maintain a record of our dealings with you; for other administrative purposes; and
      for any other purposes that we may disclose to you at the point at which we request
      your Personal Information, and pursuant to your consent."</p>

      <p>"We may also use Personal Information you provide to contact you regarding
      products, services, and offers, both from ourselves and from third parties, that we
      believe you may find of interest. We allow you to opt-out from receiving marketing
      communications from us as described in the 'Choice' section below."</p>

      <p>Disclosure of Personal Information</p>

      <p>"Except as described in this Policy, we will not disclose your Personal
      Information that we collect on the Services to third parties without your consent. We
      may disclose information to third parties if you consent to us doing so, as well as
      in the following circumstances:"</p>

      <p>"Service Providers"</p>

      <p>"We may disclose Personal Information to third-party service providers (e.g.,
      payment processing and data storage and processing facilities) that assist us in our
      work. We limit the Personal Information provided to these service providers to that
      which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions, and we require
      them to agree to maintain the confidentiality of such Personal Information."</p>

      <p>Credit Card Processing</p>

      <p>Public Areas and Syndicated Services</p>

      <p>"Some features on our Services may allow you to upload, post, or otherwise
      transmit User Materials to public areas of the Services, such as content that you
      post in a public profile on the Services. We may make these User Materials available
      for display upon Company properties that are not governed by this Policy, as well as
      to services operated by third parties that display content from the Website
      (collectively, 'Syndicated Services'). Please be aware that any Personal Information
      that you include within any User Materials will be made available to other users of
      the Services, and to users of Syndicated Services, who view it. You include Personal
      Information in User Materials at your sole risk. Additionally, even after information
      posted on the Website is removed, caching and archiving services may have saved that
      information, and other users or third parties may have copied or stored the
      information available on the Services. We cannot warrant or guarantee that any
      Personal Information that you provide on and in connection with the Services will not
      be accessed, viewed, or used by unauthorized persons."</p>

      <p>Business Transfers</p>

      <p>"Information about our users, including Personal Information, may be disclosed and
      otherwise transferred to an acquirer, or successor or assignee as part of any merger,
      acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, or similar transaction, as well
      as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which Personal
      Information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business
      assets."</p>

      <p>To Protect our Interests</p>

      <p>"We also disclose Personal Information if we believe that doing so is legally
      required, or is in our interest to protect our property or other legal rights
      (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights or
      property of others, or otherwise to help protect the safety or security of our
      Services and other users of the Services."</p>

      <p>Choice</p>

      <p>"We may allow you to post User Materials in an anonymous or non-anonymous manner,
      which may affect which User Materials may be shared with third party advertisers.
      Please review the relevant settings before posting User Materials. Please note that
      some interactions on the Service are dedicated non-anonymous by the moderators of
      those interactions. You will be notified that a given interaction is non-anonymous
      before posting any User Materials to such an interaction."</p>

      <p>"If you receive commercial e-mail from us, you may unsubscribe at any time by
      following the instructions contained within the e-mail. You may also opt-out from
      receiving commercial e-mail from us, and any other promotional communications that we
      may send to you from time to time (e.g., by postal mail) by sending your request to
      us by e-mail at [info@pol.is] or by writing to us at the address given at the end of
      this policy. Additionally, we may allow you to view and modify settings relating to
      the nature and frequency of promotional communications that you receive from us."</p>

      <p>"Please be aware that if you opt-out of receiving commercial e-mail from us, it
      may take up to ten business days for us to process your opt-out request, and you may
      receive commercial e-mail from us during that period. Additionally, even after you
      opt-out from receiving commercial messages from us, you will continue to receive
      administrative messages from us regarding our Services."</p>

      <p>Access</p>

      <p>"If we offer the ability to create user accounts or profiles on our Services, you
      may have the ability to access and update many categories of personal information
      that you provide to us by logging in to your account and accessing your account
      settings. If you wish to access or amend any other personal information we hold about
      you, you may contact us at [info@pol.is]."</p>

      <p>"If you request that we delete your account on any of our Services (via a user
      settings page, by e-mail, or otherwise), we will do so within a reasonable period of
      time, but we may need to retain some of your Personal Information in order to satisfy
      our legal obligations, or where we reasonably believe that we have a legitimate
      reason to do so."</p>

      <p>Links "The Services may contain links to other Web sites, products, or services
      that we do not own or operate. The Services may contain links to Third-Party Sites
      such as social networking services. If you choose to visit or use any Third-Party
      Sites or products or services available on or through such Third-Party Sites, please
      be aware that this Policy will not apply to your activities or any information you
      disclose while using those Third-Party Sites or any products or services available on
      or through such Third-Party Sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices
      of these Third-Party Sites or any products or services on or through them.
      Additionally, please be aware that the Services may contain links to Web sites and
      services that we operate but that are governed by different privacy policies. We
      encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies applicable to any Web site or
      service you visit other than the Services before providing any Personal Information
      on them."</p>

      <p>Children</p>

      <p>"Children's safety is important to us, and we encourage parents and guardians to
      take an active interest in the online activities of their children. We do not
      knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 without
      obtaining parental consent. If we learn that we have collected personal information
      from a child under the age of 13 on our Services, we will delete that information as
      quickly as possible. If you believe that we may have collected any such personal
      information on our Services, please notify us at info@pol.is"</p>

      <p>International Visitors</p>

      <p>"Our servers and data centers are located in the United States. If you choose to
      use the Services from outside the U.S., then you should know that you are
      transferring your Personal Information outside of your region and into the U.S. for
      storage and processing. By providing your Personal Information to us through your use
      of the Service, you agree to that transfer, storage, and processing in the U.S. Also,
      we may transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection
      with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the
      Services. You should know that each region can have its own privacy and data security
      laws, some of which may be less stringent as compared to those of your own
      region."</p>

      <p>Security</p>

      <p>"We use reasonable security measures that are designed to protect personal
      information from accidental loss, disclosure, misuse, and destruction. For instance,
      we keep all database credentials confidential through security procedures and
      confidentiality agreements and we have segregated employee access to our systems.
      Please be aware, however, that no data security measures can be guaranteed to be
      completely effective. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
      information that you provide to us. You transmit information to us at your own
      risk."</p>

      <p>"Updates to this Policy"</p>

      <p>"We may occasionally update this Policy. When we do, we will also revise the 'last
      updated' date at the beginning of the Policy. Your continued use of our Services
      after such changes will be subject to the then-current policy. If we change this
      Policy in a manner that is materially less restrictive of our use or disclosure of
      your Personal Information, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the change
      and to obtain your consent prior to applying the change to any Personal Information
      that we collected from you prior to the date the change becomes effective. We
      encourage you to periodically review this Policy to stay informed about how we
      collect, use, and disclose personal information."</p>
