// hit moderation invite url

// it seems necesary to create a list of moderators for each conversation.
// this is because you want to be able to go moderate from your inbox, even if you're not the owner.

// so the workflow is:
// hit pol.is/m/conversation_id/minvite
// this will fire an event to ensure that you're noted as a moderator.
// if not, you can't PUT to the comments. (that's the least we can do)
// we could prevent rendering the view too, but that's more work.
