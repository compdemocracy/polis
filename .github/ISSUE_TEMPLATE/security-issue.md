If you have a security concern, and especially if you believe you have found an exploit, please do not submit an issue via GitHub, but instead send us an email at <security@compdemocracy.org>. Our [security policy](https://compdemocracy.org/security) (content pending, as of this writing) is to work with you for 60 days to try and resolve the issue, and to then notify the public as soon as the issue has been resolved and deployments updated. After this time, you are welcome to publish on it openly, but we ask you for this time to maintain the security of the application and the data of it's users.

Thank you!
