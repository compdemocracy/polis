Building and Deploying for Production
-------------------------------------

As a convenience, the `deploy_TO_PRODUCTION` script is provided for deploying to AWS S3 or via SCP to a static file server.
For S3 deployment, place your AWS credentials in a JSON file at `.polis_s3_creds_client.json` that looks like this:

```json
{"key": "XXXXXXX", "secret": "YYYYYYY"}
```
