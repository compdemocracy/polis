            understanding and agreement between you and Pol.is regarding your use of and access to

            <ol>
              <li>
                "Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Pol.is in the most
                expedient and cost effective manner, you and Pol.is agree that any and all disputes
                arising in connection with these Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration.
                Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral
                arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in
                court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award
                the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate
                disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to
                any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
                misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims
                arise during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT,
                BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND POL.IS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL
                BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION."

              <li>
                "Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection 16.1, we both agree that nothing herein will
                be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an
                individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through
                applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii)
                seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to
                address intellectual property infringement claims."

                Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for
                Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, 'AAA Rules') of the American Arbitration
                Association ('AAA'), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the
                AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling
                the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Pol.is."
              </li>

              <li>
                "Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written
                notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature
                required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you,
                by electronic mail ('Notice'). The address of Pol.is for Notice is: The Authors 3601
                Fremont Ave. N, Suite 300 Seattle, WA 98103. The Notice must (i) describe the nature
                and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought
                ('Demand'). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if
                we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received,
                you or Pol.is may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the
                amount of any settlement offer made by you or Pol.is shall not be disclosed to the
                arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In
                the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Pol.is
                shall pay you (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the last
                written settlement amount offered by Pol.is in settlement of the dispute prior to
                the arbitrator's award; or (iii) $1,000.00, whichever is greater."
              </li>

              <li>
                "Fees. In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms,
                Pol.is will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is
                for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by
                the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed
                upon in King County, Washington, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less,
                you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of
                documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based
                telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules
                in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that
                either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous
                or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in
                Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be
                governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Pol.is for all
                monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under
                the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the
                arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the
                essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are
                based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and
                reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request
                from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits."

                ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
                ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and
                Pol.is agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's
                claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class
                proceeding."

                any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the
                address of Pol.is for Notice, in which case your account with Pol.is shall be
                immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately
                prior to the amendments you reject shall survive."
