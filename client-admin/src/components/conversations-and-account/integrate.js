            Copy and paste this code into your content management template. Each
            page (article, post) requires a unique string in the
            &quot;PAGE_ID&quot; field. This should be consistent over time and
            unique to each of your pages (like the article title).
          </Text>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When this embed code loads on your website, it will either create
              a new conversation (if one is not already associated with the
              string passed into PAGE_ID) or load an existing conversation.
            </li>
            <li>
              This embed code will keep track of what conversations belongs on
              what pages via the data-page_id HTML attribute.
            </li>
            <li>
              Simply replace &quot;PAGE_ID&quot;, either manually or in your
              templates, to create new conversations and load existing ones in
              the right place.
            </li>
