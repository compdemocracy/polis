# Questions/todo:
# * Do we want to use different tags for dev vs prod builds? how is this controlled?
# * Definitely want to have different env var files for prod vs dev

services:
  server:
    command: npm run dev
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: development
    # Is this what we'll want here?
    #command: npm run build:watch && npm run serve
    volumes:
      - "./server:/app"
    ports:
      - "9229:9229"

  maildev:
    image: docker.io/maildev/maildev:1.1.0
    networks:

    ports:
      # User interface
      - "1080:80"
      # SMTP port
      - "25:25"

  # TODO: Add individual entries for each of the clients, with hot-code reloading set up
  # Either:
  #   * configure environment variables here so that the ports the server points to for these assets are the
  #     live-code-reloaded ports
  #   * leave the server pointing to the static builds, but have separate ports you can hit for the live-code
  #     reloading (making sure to document the process)
