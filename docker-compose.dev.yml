# This file is an override to the original docker-compose.yml file, and as such is meant to
# extend that configuration with some additional concerns for developers, such as a maildev
# server, and exposing most ports. DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION.

# This configuration does not work on its own and must be run together with docker-compose.yml,
# e.g. `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`.
# (Note the usage in Makefile.)
# For more information see https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/

  #   * leave the server pointing to the static builds, but have separate ports you can hit for the live-code
  #     reloading (making sure to document the process)
