# polis-cypress
End-To-End Tests written with cypress.io

To run these tests:

1. Clone the repository
`git clone git@github.com:pol-is/polis-cypress.git`
`cd polis-cypress`

2. Install npm dependencies
`npm install`

3. Open up the Cypress App
`npm test`

4. Click on tests to run


NOTE: This is very alpha at this time and is hard-coded to test https://preprod.pol.is
Also most of the tests are just examples generated by Cypress.

We will be exanding this test suite and making it more flexible. Eventually this will probably be run automaticlally as part of our Github actions and build process.
