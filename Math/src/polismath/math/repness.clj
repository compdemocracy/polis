;; Participant analyses
;; ====================

;; We'd like to characterize various interesting participanti archetypes.

;; * bridge: individuals who have the potential of "bridging" the divide between groups
;;     * high a-repness in multiple groups, or
;;     * high repness in one group and high majority aggreement
;;     * look for people non-trivially in the center !!!
;; * core/extremist: (are these the same thing); Those who are most solidly within one group
;;     * high repness in a group
;;     * low consensus rep ???
;;     * lowest possible repness out of group
;;     * same as looking at how far away from center you are !!!

;; Does it make sense to even talk about representativeness of a participant to a group?
;; I think it does.
;; And I think it naturally corresponds to the partial projection k

;; repness to each group: This could be the partial projection for repful comments; do we restrict by positive?
;; consensus-followingness; don't know if we really need this...

;; Summarizing:
;;
;; I’m thinking we can implement that with two new computed things (edited)
;; the first would be a representativeness score for each participant
;; and the second would be a score for how strongly each ptpt agrees with majority opinions
