pol.is an AI powered sentiment gathering platform. More organic than surveys, less effort than focus groups.

## :construction: Disclaimer

- The documentation and configuration in this code repository is **for development ONLY**,
and emphatically **NOT intended for production deployment**.
- We do NOT make guarantees of easy setup or management, push-button deployment, security,
firm development timelines, technical support, future migration paths, data integrity,
existence of bugs, or completeness of existing features.
All of the above is actively in flux on `dev` branch.
- Work in the issue queue and codebase is being done in part by passionate volunteer contributors.
They will often be experimenting with unproven project infrastructure that is unsupported by the Polis organization,
e.g. pre-built docker images.
- See also: [Deployment: About SSL/HTTPS](docs/deployment.md#about-sslhttps)

Having said this, we are enthusiastic about your support in moving toward deployment-readiness.
We aspire to see future third-party deployments of polis as we cultivate a growing community of diverse contributors!
We look forward to working together :tada:

## 💻 Development

Our reference development environment is built on Docker.

We expect it to run either locally with vanilla `docker` or remotely with
`docker-machine`.  (e.g., on [DigitalOcean with 2GB memory][do-tut])

   [do-tut]: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-provision-and-manage-remote-docker-hosts-with-docker-machine-on-ubuntu-16-04


### Running with docker-compose:

Before running docker-compose up for the first time,
either do a pull (faster):

`docker-compose pull`

or do a build (to utilize recent or local changes):

`docker-compose up --build --detach`

subsequently you should only need to run:

`docker-compose up --detach`

To force a full re-build with no cache from previous builds:
`docker-compose build --parallel --no-cache`

And to stop:
`docker-compose down`

_(or Ctrl+C if you did not run with --detach)_

### check your ip (only necessary on docker-machine):
```
docker-machine ip
>>> 123.45.67.89
```

With docker-machine, visit your remote instance at one of: \
`http://123.45.67.89.xip.io/` \
`https://123.45.67.89.xip.io/` (insecure; browser warning)

With native docker, visit your local environment at one of: \
`http://localhost/` \
`https://localhost/` (insecure; browser warning)

Sign up at `/createuser` path. You'll be logged in right away; no email validation required!

### Misc Notes

- HTTPS is served via a self-signed SSL certificate. It's intended only for development purposes, e.g., Facebook auth.
- Facebook Login requires a Facebook app. See [`docs/deployment.md`](/docs/deployment.md#creating-a-facebook-app) for instructions.

**What features still need work?**
- ~~Generated reports~~
- Data export [`polis-issues#137`](https://github.com/pol-is/polis-issues/issues/137)

**Note:** Due to past file re-organizations, you may find the following git configuration helpful for looking at history:

```
git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
```

## 🔍 Testing

We use Cypress for automated, end-to-end browser testing! (See badge above.)

Please see [`e2e/README.md`](/e2e/README.md).

## 🚀 Deployment
